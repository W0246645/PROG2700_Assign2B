# PROG2700 Assign2B
Make an API Call
Using the list of publicly available APIs listed at https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis, write a script that retrieves some data from one of the listed public APIs of your choosing and displays it on an html page using the document.write command which writes to the Browser's DOM.

Things to consider:

Restrict your API choice to ones whose Auth type is listed as either 'No' or 'apiKey'. Refrain from selecting an API requiring an OAuth authentication.
If you choose one that uses an api Key, it is likely that you'll have to register with the api provider in order to get a key to use. If this proves difficult to figure out, choose an API with 'No' as the Auth Type value.
Restrict your API choice to ones whose CORS value is not 'No'.
Be sure that the data that is returned contains the following
At least two levels of data, and within the second level of data there should be either another JSON object or an array. Be sure to display data from all levels of data returned from the API call. You'll have to research and read up on the available documentation for the APIs you choose to see if it will meet that requirement.
You cannot choose the Deck of Cards API that is used in Part C of this assignment.

NOTE: You can simply hang on to the solution for this part of the Assignment for now. You will demonstrate the completion of this task when you submit the complete Assignment 2 video after Part 3.
